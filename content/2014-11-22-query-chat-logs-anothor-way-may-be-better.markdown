this ariticle : [openfire客户端获取聊天记录](http://www.lvxiaoyu.com/blog/2014/11/13/openfire-ke-hu-duan-huo-qu-liao-tian-ji-lu/) maybe is not nessary.

see this: (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11397172/xmppframework-retrieve-archived-messages-from-openfire-server?lq=1)

may be it is the better and earier way.

just send a <retrieve> package, you will receive a list of chat log. see doc : (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html). I have not tried, which will be my work on monday(11.24)
