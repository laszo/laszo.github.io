                <blockquote>
<p>Flask uses a concept of blueprints for making application components and supporting common patterns within an application or across applications. Blueprints can greatly simplify how large applications work and provide a central means for Flask extensions to register operations on applications. A Blueprint object works similarly to a Flask application object, but it is not actually an application. Rather it is a blueprint of how to construct or extend an application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blueprints in Flask are intended for these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Factor an application into a set of blueprints. This is ideal for larger applications; a project could instantiate an application object, initialize several extensions, and register a collection of blueprints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register a blueprint on an application at a URL prefix and/or subdomain. Parameters in the URL prefix/subdomain become common view arguments (with defaults) across all view functions in the blueprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register a blueprint multiple times on an application with different URL rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide template filters, static files, templates, and other utilities through blueprints. A blueprint does not have to implement applications or view functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register a blueprint on an application for any of these cases when initializing a Flask extension.</p>
</li>
</ul>
